# Purpose
The files in `AppScaffold` are used throughout all parts of the app (apart
from the login page).

The main components are: 
- Sidebar
    - Houses navigations options
- Header
    - Houses the logout, settings and notifications buttons
    - More functionality can be included here in the future
- Content
    - Just a container for page content, so this distinguishes
    different pages. 
- Notifications Drawer
    - For future implementation of a notifications feature
